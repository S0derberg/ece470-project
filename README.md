# ECE 470 Final Project
This is our repository for the ECE 470 final project.  Our goal is to run a simulation of the robot Baxter lifting weights.  It will try different lifts and have good form.

# How to Run
Clone this repository into your V-Rep folder.  A sample path would be "C:\Program Files\V-Rep\ece470-project."  Then open command prompt and run the command "python demo.py."

# Dependencies
You need python 3.6, numpy, scipy, sympy, and matplotlib.  And of course V-Rep needs to be installed.

# For OS Other Than Windows
The above How-to may not work if your operating system is not Windows.  An alternative would be to just take our demo.py file and put it in a similar folder to this repository with the correct dependent files that work on your OS.
